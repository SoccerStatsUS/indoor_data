Competition: Major Indoor Soccer League (2001-2008


*Major Indoor Soccer League II
*
*Also AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL SOCCER ASSOCIATION, 1984-1990; 
*NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCCER LEAGUE, 1991-2001
*The Major Indoor Soccer League II started in 1984 as the American Indoor Soccer Association, and was intended as an alternative to the then well established original Major Indoor Soccer League. The name of the league was changed to National Professional Soccer League in 1990. Rivalry between the two leagues grew heated in the late 1980's, and ultimately led to the demise of the original MISL, and the end of a destructive salary and trade war. The NPSL was restructured in August 2001 as the new Major Indoor Soccer League, now a single-entity structure like Major League Soccer. Late in the fall of 2001, the league absorbed the World Indoor Soccer League. Financial troubles forced the leagueâ€™s demise in 2002, but the teams, around new management formed a new single-entity league that year. The MISL finally folded in 2008, with the teams dispersing to the new Extreme Soccer League, National Indoor Soccer League and American Indoor Soccer League.
